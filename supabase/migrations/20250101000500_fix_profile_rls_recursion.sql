# [CRITICAL] Final Reset of `profiles` RLS Policies to Fix Recursion
This migration script performs a definitive reset of the Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `profiles` table to permanently resolve a recurring "infinite recursion" error.

## Query Description:
This operation is designed to fix a critical database error that is making the application unusable. It will:
1. **Aggressively drop all existing policies** on the `public.profiles` table. This is essential to remove the misconfigured policy causing the infinite loop.
2. **Create one new, simple, and safe policy**. This policy allows users to view and edit ONLY their own profile data.
3. **Intentionally omits a global admin policy for now**. The previous admin policies were the source of the recursion. To guarantee stability, a more advanced solution is needed for admin access, which can be implemented in a future step.

This change will make the main application stable and functional. Some features in the Admin Panel that rely on viewing all users may be temporarily affected. This is a necessary trade-off to fix the core application.

## Metadata:
- Schema-Category: "Security"
- Impact-Level: "High"
- Requires-Backup: false
- Reversible: false (Old policies are dropped)

## Structure Details:
- Affects Table: `public.profiles`
- Operations: `DROP POLICY`, `CREATE POLICY`

## Security Implications:
- RLS Status: Enabled
- Policy Changes: Yes. All policies on `public.profiles` are replaced with a single, stricter policy. This resolves a critical security flaw (the recursion) and correctly scopes user access to their own data.

## Performance Impact:
- Estimated Impact: High (Positive). Resolves an infinite loop that was causing all data-fetching to fail.

-- Step 1: Drop all conceivable policies on the profiles table to ensure a clean slate.
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile." ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile." ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all profiles." ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for all users" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all access to admin" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow individual read access" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow individual update access" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admin full access" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow individual access to own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only access their own profile" ON public.profiles;


-- Step 2: Ensure RLS is enabled and forced on the profiles table.
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.profiles FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 3: Create a single, safe policy for users to access their OWN profile.
-- This policy is non-recursive and is the standard, secure way to grant self-access.
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
